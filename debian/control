Package: psrchive
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, csh
Description: analysis of pulsar astronomical data
  It implements an extensive range of algorithms for use in pulsar timing,
  scintillation studies, polarimetric calibration, single-pulse work, RFI
  mitigation, etc. These tools are utilized by a powerful suite of user-end
  programs that come with the library. The software is described in Hotan, van
  Straten & Manchester (2004).
