* 1)  options menu change verbosity (radio check menu?)
2)  signal on qt_editParams::exit that allows Rhythm to act also
3)  confirm save on exit/close
* 4)  adjust window properly
# 5)  change that which is plotted (sec/turns) (MJD/orbitalphase)
6)  colour points by frequency
# 7)  fit only selected points
* 8)  update/load points to be plotted without changing window
9)  expert mode does not confirm saving before exit
# 10) remove offset in MJD to increase precision
11) tempo output to /dev/null (except in vverbose)
12) filter out points using error ranges
13) discuss what is the "wrap" issue with Matthew
14) id points calls external plot program with filename

EVENTUALLY?
