    In the following, pulsar-specific information is recorded for use 
    by folding programs e.g. the quick-look software. This is passed to 
    WAPP by psrcontrol at the start of the observation. 

    The apparent pulse phase and frequency at time "dt" minutes with
    respect to the start of the observation are then calculated as:

    phase = rphase + dt*60*f0 + coeff[0] + dt*coeff[1] + dt*dt*coeff[2] + ...
    freq(Hz) = f0 + (1/60)*(coeff[1] + 2*dt*coeff[2] + 3*dt*dt*coeff[3] + ...)

    where the C notation has been used (i.e. coeff[0] is first coefficient etc)
